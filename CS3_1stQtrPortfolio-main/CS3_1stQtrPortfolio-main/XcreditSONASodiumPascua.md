# Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr by Jed Pascua, 9-Sodium
1. Better quality education system, using new methods to increase the production in agriculture, More PhilHealth benefits for all.


2. Anti-corruption. It has been such an issue for such a long time that it makes me question why only now? Well, I assume that Marcos only gave it attention because of the recent dismal flood-control projects.


3. Honestly, while watching the live video, there was nothing in me that felt hopeful during Marcos's entire talk. Each year, president's give promises that they will achieve each year, yet usually, they only achieve a fraction of what they talked about. If you think about it, the 20 peso per kilo of bigas promise that he made is very likely impossible. Achieving it as a nationwide market price for everyone, without continuous and massive help from the government is a significant challenge, and with the recent issues on corruption, my expectations have been at an all-time low.
On a lighter note, the Marcos administration has apparently done a lot in various different sectors, such as healthcare, education, economic, and agriculture. However, I still remain on edge as I do not know whether what Marcos said was true or not. For me, SONA 2025 has been like any other. The only notable thing mentioned was the anti-corruption drive.


4. Difficult to fix
