# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with three to five sentences.
1. **Output/Input Statements** - We learned about 4 different output statements and 1 input statement. There's console.log, which outputs to the browser's console. Then we have the alert() method that displays alert dialog boxes. There's also document.write(), which outputs to the browser window, and finally, we have document.getElementById(id) which requires inserting the output using the innerHTML property and displaying it. For input statements, we have the prompt box, which requires you to input a value, and the confirm box, which allows the user to select between "Ok" or "Cancel" in order to continue.
2. **Conditional Statements** - If-else, Rational Operators, Logical Operators, and Switch Statements have all been taught to us in the past by C++. Thus, this lesson has been particularly easy. However, the incorporation of the different Output/Input statements was the only difficulty for me in writing if-else statements.
3. **Loops** - Again, most loops that we've studied in JavaScrpt have already been introduced to us by C++. This includes the While Loop, Do While Loop, and the For Loop. With the exception of the For In Loop, this lesson was fun to relearn. Although, I don't think I can fully say that I've mastered this lesson as I can't see myself answering a complex problem using my current knowledge on loops.
4. **Assignment Operators** - This uses one equal sign to assign the value of the right operand to the left. There is the Simple Assignment Operator (=), and there are Compound Assignment Operators, which are written in shorthand form (+=, -=, *=, etc.). The logic in these operators were quite easy to understand. I had no trouble in learning about them.
5. **Comparison Operators** - This compares two values, whether they are ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, or ===. When the condition is true, it will display "True". When it is false, it will display "False". An interesting Comparison Operator to look at is the strictly equal operator. This not only checks whether the two values are equal, but it also checks whether they are of the same type.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. **Logical Operators** - I'm still pretty confused by what it will return for non-Boolean operands, but I think I just need a bit more practice on it.
2. **Event Handlers** -  This topic still confuses me, and I still don't get how it works and why we use it.
3. **Anonymous Functions** - I do not get the syntax for these types of functions at all.
4. **For...of Loops** - I saw an example of these type of loops in the js-loops-and-arrays Digital Garden file that Sir Roy sent, and I still don't know how the loop works.
5. **forEach Loops** - Similar to For...of Loop, I have never encountered this type of loop before. Thus I am very unfamiliar with the syntax and how it works.

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. I will review/recall the different outputs when comparing Logical Operators and do practice excercises and/or make analogies on what I find.
2. I will do some research on my own and re-read the lesson on Event Handlers to deepen my understanding.
3. I will find other sources, examples, and excercises, on Anonymous Functions.
4. I will find other references for For...of Loops and/or I will ask a friend who understands how they work.
5. I will find other references for forEach Loops and/or I will ask a friend who understands how they work.

# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
### Effective Actvities
1. **All the different sample codes** - Sir Roy typed in the sample codes by hand so that we could follow. This helped me a lot personally because it felt cool to get the code right and it was also very helpful because it helped me identify the different errors that I made.
2. **The Bonus, Hard-Coded Word Guessing Game** - For me, this exercise was very effective, because not only was the code not something we get to code everyday, but it was also the fact that we could follow the process even though it was hard and understand what was happening.
### Not so effective Activities
1. **The activity where we took a picture of ourselves in a Filipiniana** - I didn't really pick up anything from this activity other than the fact that I got to see the syntax for the code that Sir Roy used.
2. **The "Things I like to do" thread** - Alright, this one was a bit fun, but again, I didn't pick up many learnings from this actvity.
